## Wave â€“ background
Wave aims to be a modern audio gui based on Volumio, this forks main mission is to modernize the look and feel of the volumio project and migrate it to a vuejs project


Volumio is an headless audiophile music player, designed to play music with the highest possible fidelity. Volumio runs on most embedded devices (Raspberry Pi, UDOO, Odroid, Cubieboard, Beaglebone, Pine64, Allo Sparky...) and on any ordinary PC (x86).

## Volumio 2 Virtual Machines 

Some VM images are available, although they're not always kept up-to-date. It can be an alternative to developing directly on target (Raspberry Pi, or whatever).

VMWARE Image is suggested, as Network configuration is tricky with Virtual Box 

* [VMWare Virtual Machine - Beta1](http://repo.volumio.org/Volumio2/DevTools/VolumioVM-VMWare.zip)
* [Virtual Box Virtual Machine - Alpha5](http://repo.volumio.org/Volumio2/DevTools/VolumioVM-VirtualBox.zip)

System Images built with [Volumio Builder](https://github.com/volumio/Build)
